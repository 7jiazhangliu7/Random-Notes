If you declare any variable as static, it is known static variable.
    1. The static variable can be used to refer the common property of all objects (that is not unique for each object) 
       e.g. company name of employees,college name of students etc.
    2. The static variable gets memory only once in class area at the time of class loading.

If you apply static keyword with any method, it is known as static method.
    1. A static method belongs to the class rather than object of a class.
    2. A static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.
    3. static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.
    
There are two main restrictions for the static method. They are:
    1. The static method can not use non static data member or call non-static method directly.
    2. this and super cannot be used in static context.
    
Q) why java main method is static?
    Ans) because object is not required to call static method if it were non-static method, jvm create object first then call main() method that will lead the problem of extra memory allocation.

3) Java static block
    Is used to initialize the static data member.
    It is executed before main method at the time of classloading.
