Key points: Here are the key points to remember about interfaces:
1) We can’t instantiate an interface in java.

2) Interface provides complete abstraction as none of its methods can have body. On the other hand, abstract class provides partial abstraction as it can have abstract and concrete(methods with body) methods both.

3) implements keyword is used by classes to implement an interface.

4) While providing implementation in class of any method of an interface, it needs to be mentioned as public.

5) Class implementing any interface must implement all the methods, otherwise the class should be declared as “abstract”.

6) Interface cannot be declared as private, protected or transient.

7) All the interface methods are by default abstract and public.

8) Variables declared in interface are public, static and final by default.
